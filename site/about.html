                    So, for the final project in my Intro to Web Development class, we were given a two-part final project. One was to be done solo, and one was to be done as part of a group.
                    <br><br>
                    For my individual portion, after much consideration, I decided to create a website for a real-time strategy game. My initial hope was that I would have time to include a playable game accesible via the website, but unfortunately that did not pan out.

                <div class="section-title-wrapper">
                    <div class="section-title">Hold on, what is real-time strategy?</div>
                </div>
                <p>I'm glad you asked!</p>
                <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy games including games like Age of Empires. Gameplay involves controlling large groups of units which can be assigned to different tasks. Units typically have different functionalities. Upgrades, often in the form of buildings, let you get more advanced units, upgrade existing units, or simply allows for more units overall.</p>
                <p>RTS games require you to both manage individual units and maintain a focus on the bigger picture in order to defeat opponents and win. Being able to multitask and focus on multiple areas at once is key.</p>
