                    This website was created for the solo portion of my final project for my Intro to Web Development class. It is designed around a hypothetical RTS game made for the web, 
                    <br><br>
                    You may notice that in the abstract, I had initially hoped to include a playable prototype if I had time. Unfortunately, that did not pan out.

                <p>I'm glad you asked!</p>
                <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy games including games like Age of Empires. Gameplay involves controlling large groups of units which can be assigned to different tasks. Units typically have different functionalities. Upgrades, often in the form of buildings, let you get more advanced units, upgrade existing units, or simply allows for more units overall.</p>
                <p>RTS games require you to both manage individual units and maintain a focus on the bigger picture in order to defeat opponents and win. Being able to multitask and focus on multiple areas at once is key.</p>
